Basic iOS app that acts as a keyboard.

Uses Pd patch and Xcode audio frameworks to handle midi sound production.

Unable to use multiple touches at once.

Touches cannot slide along keyboard - must pick up finger and touch individually.

Next steps:  to correct the above bugs by changing the interface from UIButtons/IBActions to a view with gesture recognizers.
